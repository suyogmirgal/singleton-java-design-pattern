# Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.



### Example:
#### Database Connectivity:
Singleton Design Pattern can be understood by a very simple example of Database connectivity. 
When each process creates a unique Database Connection to the Database, 
it will highly affect the cost and expenses of the project. 
So, it is always better to make a single connection.
